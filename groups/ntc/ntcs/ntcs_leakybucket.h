/// @internal @brief
/// Provide a mechanism to monitor the consumption rate of a resource.
///
/// @details
/// Provide a mechanism that implements a leaky bucket algorithm to
/// allows clients to monitor whether a resource is being consumed at a
/// particular rate.
///
/// The name of this mechanism, leaky bucket, derives from an analogy of
/// pouring water into a bucket with a hole at the bottom.  The maximum rate at
/// which water will drain out the bucket depends on the size of the hole, and
/// not on the rate at which water is poured into the bucket.  If more water is
/// being poured into the bucket than being drained, the bucket will eventually
/// overflow.  If the person pouring water into a leaky bucket ensures the
/// bucket doesn't overflow, then the average rate they pour water will, over
/// time, be limited by the rate at which water flows out of the bucket.  By
/// analogy, a leaky bucket provides a means to limit the rate of consumption
/// of some resource (water poured into the bucket) to a configured rate (the
/// size of the hole in the bucket).
///
/// The behavior of a leaky bucket is determined by two properties: the
/// capacity and the drain rate.  The drain rate, measured in 'units/s', is the
/// rate at which the resource is drained.  The capacity, measured in 'units',
/// is the maximum amount of the resource that the leaky bucket can hold before
/// it overflows.  'unit' is a generic unit of measurement (e.g., bytes, number
/// of messages, packets, liters, clock cycles, etc.).  Note that the drain
/// rate determines average rate of resource consumption, while the capacity
/// restricts the time period over which the average actual rate of resource
/// consumption approaches the drain rate.
///
/// @par Adding Units
/// Units can be added to a leaky bucket by either submitting them or reserving
/// them.  Submitted units are removed from a leaky bucket at the drain rate,
/// while reserved units remain unchanged until they are later either cancelled
/// (removed from the leaky bucket) or submitted.
///
/// @par Submitting Units
/// Units can be submitted to a leaky bucket by invoking the 'submit' method,
/// and should be added only after the resource had been consumed.
///
/// Figure 1 illustrates a typical workflow for submitting units to a leaky
/// bucket.
///
///     Fig. 1:  Capacity = 5 units, Rate = 1 unit / second

/// Suppose that we have an empty leaky bucket with a capacity of 'c = 5 units'
/// and a drain rate of 'd = 1 units/s'.  At 't0', we submit 5 units to the

/// Units can be reserved for a leaky bucket using the 'reserve' method, and

/// up to 3.  At 't0 + 9s', we observe that all but the remaining reserved unit
/// have been drained from the bucket.  Finally, at 't0 + 10s', we cancel the
/// remaining reserved unit.
///
/// @par Monitoring Resource Usage
/// The recommended usage of a leaky bucket is to first check whether 1 unit
/// can be added without causing the leaky bucket to overflow, and if so,
/// consume the desired amount of the resource.  Afterwards, submit the amount
/// of consumed resource to the leaky bucket.
///
/// @par Checking for Overflow
/// A leaky bucket can be queried whether submitting a 1 more unit would cause
/// it to overflow via the 'wouldOverflow' method.  This method facilitates the
/// recommended usage of a leak bucket: check whether 1 more unit can be added
/// without causing the leaky bucket to overflow, and if so, consume the
/// desired amount of the resource (which may be more than 1).  Compared to the
/// alternative -- checking whether the desired amount can be submitted without
/// overflow -- this recommended usage may allow a limited spike in the rate of
/// actual consumption when the leaky bucket is empty (which is often
/// acceptable) but is able to sustain a long term average that is actually
/// closer to the drain rate.
///
/// @par Modeling a Network Connection
/// The primary use case of leaky bucket is limiting the rate at which data is
/// written on a network.  In this use case, the drain rate of the bucket
/// corresponds to the *ideal* maximum transmission rate that the client wishes
/// to enforce on their outgoing connection.  Clients may choose to provide a
/// value related to the physical limitations of their network or any other
/// arbitrary limit.  The function of a leaky bucket's capacity is to limit the
/// time period over which the average actual transimission rate may exceed the
/// configured drain rate of the leaky bucket (see 'Approximations' section and
/// 'Sliding Time-Window' section).
///
/// @par Approximations
/// Leaky bucket is modeled on a water bucket with a hole, but as a leaky
/// bucket does not manage any resources, there are several approximations to
/// this model:
///
/// -# Units are submitted instantaneously to the leaky bucket, whereas the
///    consumption of a resource occurs over time at a rate that depends on the
///    nature and speed of the resource.
///
/// -# Leaky bucket simulates the consumption of a resource with a specified
///    fixed drain rate, but the resource is actually consumed at different
///    rates over time.  This approximation still guarantees that the actual
///    consumption rate does not exceed the specified drain rate when amortized
///    over some configured period of time (determined by the capacity and the
///    drain rate of the bucket), but does not prevent the consumption rate
///    from spiking above the drain rate for shorter periods of time (see
///    'Sliding Time-Window' section).
///
/// @par Sliding Time-Window
/// One of the properties of the resource pattern created by using a lleaky
/// bucket is an approximation of a sliding time window over which the average
/// consumption rate is guaranteed to be less than the drain rate.  This time
/// period can be calculated using the leaky bucket's capacity and drain rate,
/// which can be conveniently performed using the 'calculateTimeWindow' class
/// method.
///
/// @par Time Synchronization
/// Leaky bucket does not utilize an internal timer, so timing must be handled
/// manually.  Clients can specify an initial time interval for the leaky
/// bucket at construction or using the 'reset' method.  Whenever the number of
/// units in a leaky bucket needs to be updated, clients must invoke the
/// 'updateState' method specifying the current time interval.  Since leaky
/// bucket cares only about the elapsed time (not absolute time), the specified
/// time intervals may be relative to any arbitrary time origin, though all of
/// them must refer to the same origin.  For the sake of consistency, clients
/// are encouraged to use the unix epoch time (such as the values returned by
/// 'bdlt::CurrentTime:::now').
///
/// @par Usage Example 1: Controlling Network Traffic Generation
/// In some systems, data is processed faster than they are consumed by I/O
/// interfaces.  This could lead to data loss due to the overflowing of the
/// buffers where data is queued before being processed.  In other systems,
/// generic resources are shared, and their consumption might need to be
/// managed in order to guarantee quality-of-service (QOS).
///
/// Suppose we have a network interface capable of transferring at a rate of
/// 1024 byte/s and an application wants to transmit 5 KB (5120 bytes) of data
/// over that network in 20 different 256-bytes data chunks.  We want to send
/// data over this interface and want to ensure the transmission uses on
/// average less than 50% of the available bandwidth, or 512 byte/s.  In this
/// way, other clients can still reasonably send and receive data using the
/// same network interface.
///
/// Further suppose that we have a function, 'sendData', that transmits a
/// specified data buffer over that network interface:
///
///     bool sendData(const char *buffer, size_t dataSize);
///         // Send the specified 'buffer' of the specified size 'dataSize'
///         // through the network interface.  Return 'true' if data was sent
///         // successfully, and 'false' otherwise.
///
/// First, we create a leaky bucket having a drain rate of 512 bytes/s, a
/// capacity of 2560 bytes, and a time origin set to the current time (as an
/// interval from unix epoch).  Note that 'unit', the unit of measurement for
/// leaky bucket, corresponds to 'byte' in this example:
///
///     bsl::uint64_t      rate     = 512;  // bytes/second
///     bsl::uint64_t      capacity = 2560; // bytes
///     bsls::TimeInterval now      = bdlt::CurrentTime::now();
///
///     LeakyBucket bucket(rate, capacity, now);
///
/// Then, we define a data buffer to be sent, the size of each data chunk, and
/// the total size of the data to transmit:
///
///     char           buffer[5120];
///     bsl::size_t   chunkSize  = 256;             // in bytes
///     bsl::uint64_t totalSize  = 20 * chunkSize;  // in bytes
///     bsl::uint64_t dataSent   = 0;               // in bytes
///
///     // Load 'buffer'.
///     // ...
///
/// Notice that, for the sake of brevity, we elide the loading of 'buffer' with
/// the data to be sent.
///
/// Now, we send the chunks of data using a loop.  For each iteration, we check
/// whether submitting another byte would cause the leaky bucket to overflow.
/// If not, we send an additional chunk of data and submit the number of bytes
/// sent to the leaky bucket.  Note that 'submit' is invoked only after the
/// data has been sent.
///
///     char *data = buffer;
///     while (dataSent < totalSize) {
///         now = bdlt::CurrentTime::SystemTime::now();
///         if (!bucket.wouldOverflow(now)) {
///             if (true == sendData(data, chunkSize)) {
///                 data += chunkSize;
///                 bucket.submit(chunkSize);
///                 dataSent += chunkSize;
///             }
///         }
///
/// Finally, if submitting another byte will cause the leaky bucket to
/// overflow, then we wait until the submission will be allowed by waiting for
/// an amount time returned by the 'calculateTimeToSubmit' method:
///
///         else {
///             bsls::TimeInterval timeToSubmit =
///                                bucket.calculateTimeToSubmit(now);
///
///             // Round up the number of microseconds.
///             bsl::uint64_t uS = timeToSubmit.totalMicroseconds() +
///                             ((timeToSubmit.nanoseconds() % 1000) ? 1 : 0);
///
///             bslmt::ThreadUtil::microSleep(uS);
///         }
///     }
///
/// Notice that we wait by putting the thread into a sleep state instead of
/// using busy-waiting to better optimize for multi-threaded applications.
